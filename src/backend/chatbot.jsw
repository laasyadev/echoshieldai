Gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse in which the abuser seeks to make the victim doubt their own perceptions, memories, or reality. This behavior is a tactic used to control and disorient the victim, making them feel confused or uncertain about their sense of self. It can involve the abuser denying facts, dismissing the victim's emotions, and manipulating them into questioning their worth or sanity. This kind of abuse is incredibly harmful and can lead to long-term psychological damage, including anxiety, depression, and loss of self-esteem. If you or someone you know is experiencing this, it is important to seek help immediately.";
